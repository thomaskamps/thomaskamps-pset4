## Code Review
  
1 - The names of the variables you chose are most of the times well chosen, try to get all of them right.  
2 - There is a general lack of comments, really remember to add some!  
3 - Your storyboard looks clean and ordered.  
4 - The layout of your app looks very good, everything is neat and the screen is rotatable.  
5 - The formatting of your code is overall pretty good and readable.  
6 - Choose the name of your controllers wisely, and try not to have too much duplicate code between them.  
7 - Your app contains much duplicate code, for instance the pieces of code that handle API-calls.  
8 - You do pay attention to using constants and variables.  
9 - Typecasting is a bit of a mess at some places.  
10 - Code is divisioned into multiple lines when it is about to get messy. This allows for good reading.
