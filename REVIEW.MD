## Code Review

1 - The chosen variable names are mostly good and associated with what they do.
2 - There are no header comments present, so they should be added.
3 - The general comments throughout the code are good and provide enough information.
4 - Layout of the elements is fine, but no special care taken to order it.
5 - The format of the code is usually good, at some points a little more whitespace is wanted.
6 - Flow is pretty simple and easy to follow.
7 - Too much duplicate code, with two full AsyncTasks that almost do the same and the repeating button handlers at the bottom of each file.
8 - The variables are mostly reused, but it could be more efficient.
9 - The modules are quite seperated which makes it easy to read the code.
10 - The statments per line are usually not too dense, which allows for an easy distinctions with what each line does.
